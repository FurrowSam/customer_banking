# Customer Banking

Customer Banking is a utility that allows customers to input savings and CD balance, interest rate and length of investments and returns how much interest was earned over time along with the updated balance of each account. 

## Description of files
In the Account file is where the Account class is defined along with the set balance and set interest.
The savings account and cd account files both store the function for creating said accounts and calculating the interest and returning the updated balance to reflect the addition of the interest earned over the term of months. 
The customer banking file is where the main function lives and the file which you will run in your terminal. 

### Instructions
- Open the customer_banking file in your terminal.
- Run the file.
- Enter your balance, interest rate and select a term of months. 


**This function will run twice, first for your savings and again for your CD.**
